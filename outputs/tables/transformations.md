# Data Cleaning & Transformation Log

**Dataset:** HMWSSB Water Tanker Bookings (Jan 2022, Hyderabad)  
**Local Copy:** data/hmwssb_water_tankers_jan2022.csv  
**Processed On:** 2025-09-06

## 🔹 Transformations Applied

1. **Column Standardization**
   - Original headers: `date, district, vehicle_no, from, destination, litres`
   - Renamed to canonical schema:
     - `vehicle_no` → `vehicle_id`
     - `from` → `source_point`
     - `destination` → `dest_point`
     - `litres` → `volume`
   - ✅ Rationale: Consistent naming across datasets for analysis.

2. **Scope Reduction**
   - Filtered dataset to **district = Hyderabad**.
   - ✅ Rationale: Keep demo manageable while showing end-to-end workflow.

3. **Date Normalization**
   - Converted `date` field into ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - ✅ Rationale: Standardized time handling for trend analysis.

4. **Missing Values**
   - No nulls found in this sample (3 records).
   - ✅ Rationale: Verified data integrity.

5. **Data Type Conversion**
   - `volume` cast to integer.  
   - `vehicle_id` kept as string.  
   - ✅ Rationale: Ensures numeric operations run without errors.

## 🔹 Implications for Analysis

- All downstream analysis reflects **Hyderabad only**, January 2022.  
- Vehicle activity counts are accurate for this slice, but not representative of other districts.  
- Policy insights should be interpreted as **sample demonstration**, not statewide view.

## 🔹 Next Steps for Full Dataset
- Extend pipeline to all districts.  
- Handle potential duplicates and missing bookings.  
- Cross-check tanker supply vs population needs for policy planning.
